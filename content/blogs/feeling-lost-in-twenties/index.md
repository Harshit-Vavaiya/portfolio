Twenties are the years where you are young and full of life and ready to take on the world. And yet again, this is the time where one often feels most lost in life.

I am a 25 year old computer science graduate, and I feel like I have no idea where I will end up in life. Everything just feels fast and life slipping through my hand.

I have seen and experience rise of AI technologies while pursuing my graduation in Germany. Every month new groundbreaking AI product enters market and it feels we are ever closer to AGI.

Where do I fit in all this? Do I even have a place in this future dictated by super intelligent agents where my four years of learning programming can be done by a model with few tokens.

Industry experts say this is the revolution that will separate great engineers from the great. Do I have what it takes to be great? Well I thought so once, long ago.

Three decades ago, twenties were a time to explore yourself and learn about yourself and the world. Travel, make mistakes, have fun and wander in the darkest of alleys to find your own light.

For me that was the romantic era. Did they feel this hopeless as well? even if they did, were their existence and intelligence were challenged by an artificial brain?

It does sound like I feel threatened by AI, the truth is, I feel threatened by uncertainty. And maybe they also felt the same uncertainty, AI or not, but uncertainty of what holds for them in this ever changing world.

I don't know if I will still be in tech after ten years, but I hope at least that I have understood that uncertainty is what makes life exciting.
