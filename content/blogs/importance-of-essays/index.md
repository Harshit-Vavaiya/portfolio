When you write, you think. When you think, you observe. When you observe, you learn. When you learn, you ask questions. When you ask questions, you improve yourself. And when you improve and grow, you fulfill one true purpose of mankind. Leaving the world a better place.

Writing has been key ( I dare say the most important ) invention in the history mankind. It began with glyphs in caves and evolved throughout earth differently. A way to organize thoughts and ideas.

And essays are great form of writing to sculpt your brain and critical thinking. It forces you to write about a certain topic in constrained manner. Leading to concise and precise arguments and statements, produced by critical thinking beforehand.
